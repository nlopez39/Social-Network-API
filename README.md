## Description

This Express app mimics a social media platform resembling Twitter. Users can register accounts where they can share their 'thoughts,' which act as posts reflecting their current feelings or ideas. Additionally, users have the ability to manage their friends list by adding or removing connections, and they can react to other users' 'thoughts.' The functionality closely resembles that of Twitter, providing users with a familiar social media experience.
