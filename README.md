- OFFICE HOURS - ask this:
- User Friends Add and Remove not working. However when I click on POST twice for add it does it then. DELETE just deletes the user record completely.
- deleteThought not working: must be clicked twice to delete :/ a thought
- addReaction does not create an id nor a createdAt property????
