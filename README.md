# Social-Network-API

## TODO:

- OFFICE HOURS - ask this:
- User Routes update not working
- User Friends Add and Remove not working. However when I click on POST twice for add it does it then. DELETE just deletes the user record completely.
- Ask at OH about the layout of the code, why do we have all of these files?
- TODO :
- complete the Thought Routes and Thought Controllers
- and this part /api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions
- make the video
- and a readme on github
